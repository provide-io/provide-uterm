## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-07

### Added

- **CF Access / Zero Trust JWT support** — `JwtConfig.jwt_default_role` (env var
  `JWT_DEFAULT_ROLE`, default `"viewer"`) assigns a role when the JWT has no `roles` or
  `scope` claim. Cloudflare Access JWTs omit roles by default; set `JWT_DEFAULT_ROLE=operator`
  to grant all CF Access users operator access without claim transforms.
- **E2E test suite** — `tests/test_e2e_ws.py` adds 10 async tests covering: worker
  connect/disconnect KV registration, browser hello frame, snapshot delivery, hijack
  acquire/release/conflict (409), alarm-based lease expiry, input_mode change, and fleet
  session listing. Tests run via `pywrangler dev` locally (`-m e2e`) or against a live
  deployment (`REAL_CF=1 REAL_CF_URL=https://...`).
- **`REAL_CF_URL` fixture support** — `conftest.py` `wrangler_server` fixture skips local
  `pywrangler dev` startup when `REAL_CF_URL` is set, yielding the remote URL directly.
- **CF Access groups-based role mapping** — documented in `wrangler.toml`: configure SCIM
  identity groups in the Zero Trust dashboard, add a custom JWT claim (e.g. `"groups"`), and
  set `JWT_ROLES_CLAIM=groups` to map group membership to viewer/operator/admin roles.
- **Full-stack E2E tests** — `tests/test_e2e_full_stack.py` tests the complete proxy chain:
  `HostedSessionRuntime` (Python) → CF DO (WebSocket) → browser WS. Covers connect/appear,
  snapshot delivery, hijack cycle, two-browser broadcast, and post-hibernation state persistence.
- **Unit test coverage expansions** — `tests/test_coverage2.py` brings `bridge/hijack.py` to
  100%, `state/registry.py` to 100%, and extends `auth/jwt.py` and `state/store.py` coverage
  with edge-case branches. `tests/test_http_routes_coverage.py` brings `api/http_routes.py`
  to 99% (all route handlers: 403/404/400/409 paths).

### Fixed

- **DO hibernation: worker_id always "default"** — `ctx.id.name()` returns `"default"` in
  the CF Python runtime. Added `_lazy_init_worker_id()` which extracts the real worker ID from
  the request URL path in `fetch()`, before KV registration and attachment serialization.
- **DO hibernation: KV registration dropped** — `webSocketOpen` is a no-op after hibernation.
  Worker connect now registers in KV synchronously inside `fetch()` before returning the 101
  Switching Protocols response, so the entry is always written.
- **DO hibernation: browser hello frame dropped** — `webSocketOpen` handler runs after
  hibernation wake but is not reliably async-awaitable. The hello frame is now sent
  synchronously via `server.send()` inside `fetch()` before the 101 response.
- **DO hibernation: `broadcast_to_browsers` empty after wake** — `self.browser_sockets` is
  reset to `{}` when the DO hibernates. `broadcast_to_browsers` now uses
  `ctx.getWebSockets()` to enumerate live sockets, falling back to the in-memory dict.
- **DO hibernation: close handlers lost role/worker_id** — `webSocketClose` compared
  `ws is self.worker_ws` which is always `False` after hibernation (`self.worker_ws = None`).
  Role and worker_id are now encoded in the WS attachment (`"role:browser_role:worker_id"`)
  and recovered via `_socket_role()` / `_socket_worker_id()` in close handlers.
- **KV `put` with `expirationTtl` fails silently** — Pyodide cannot map Python keyword
  arguments to the CF Workers KV JS options object. The `expirationTtl` parameter was removed;
  entries are cleaned up explicitly via `kv.delete()` on disconnect.
- **CF Bot Fight Mode blocks E2E HTTP requests** — Python `urllib.request` default User-Agent
  is blocked by CF Bot Fight Mode (error 1010). All E2E HTTP helpers now send
  `User-Agent: provide-terminal-e2e-test/1.0`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Fleet-wide session registry** — `state/registry.py` provides `update_kv_session` /
  `list_kv_sessions` helpers backed by a `SESSION_REGISTRY` KV binding. The Default Worker
  returns all sessions fleet-wide when KV is configured, with a `X-Sessions-Scope: fleet`
  response header; falls back to `local` (single-DO) scope when KV is absent.
- **KV heartbeat via Durable Object alarm** — `alarm()` reschedules itself every 60 s and
  refreshes the KV entry (300 s TTL safety net), preventing zombie entries when a DO hibernates.
- **`/hijack/{hid}/snapshot` endpoint** — returns the last stored terminal snapshot (in-memory
  or SQLite fallback) for polling-based hijack clients.
- **Contract parity TypedDicts** — `contracts.py` defines TypedDicts for all REST response
  shapes and a `RuntimeProtocol` structural interface to align the DO and test doubles without
  circular imports.
- **`input_mode` persistence** — new `input_mode` SQLite column (idempotent `ALTER TABLE`
  migration), `save_input_mode()` store method, and restore in `_restore_state()` so the mode
  survives hibernation.
- **`min_event_seq` store method** — `store.min_event_seq()` returns the oldest retained event
  sequence number; the events endpoint now includes `min_event_seq` in its response.
- **JWKS key selection by algorithm** — when a JWT has no `kid` header, `auth/jwt.py` filters
  JWKS keys by the `alg` header rather than returning the first key unconditionally.
- **`HijackCoordinator` always generates new UUID** — `acquire()` generates a fresh
  `hijack_id` on every call, preventing replay of stale IDs across hibernation cycles.

### Fixed

- **KV `input_mode` staleness** — `update_kv_session` now accepts and forwards the current
  `input_mode`; called with the live mode on connect and on every alarm heartbeat.
- **`webSocketError` left KV zombie** — the KV entry is now deleted when the worker WebSocket
  closes with an error, matching the behaviour of `webSocketClose`.
- **`_socket_browser_role` was fail-open** — auth modes other than `none`/`dev` now default
  to `"viewer"` instead of `"admin"` when role resolution is unavailable.
- **Blocking JWKS fetch** — `PyJWKClient.get_signing_key_from_jwt()` (synchronous
  `urllib.request`) replaced with an async `js.fetch` path in CF Workers and a `urllib`
  fallback for test environments, keeping the event loop unblocked.
- **`/api/sessions` single-DO scope** — Default Worker reads KV to return all fleet sessions;
  the old implementation only returned the current DO's session.
- **`_run()` masked SQL exceptions** — the dual-calling-convention fallback in
  `SqliteStateStore._run()` now re-raises the original exception rather than swallowing it when
  both invocation styles fail.
- **`ws_key` visibility** — renamed from `_ws_key` to `ws_key` (public method on
  `RuntimeProtocol` and `SessionRuntime`) so WS routes can call it without name-mangling.

### Security

- **Admin-only input mode and disconnect** — `POST /worker/{id}/input_mode` and
  `POST /worker/{id}/disconnect_worker` now return HTTP 403 for non-admin callers.
- **Empty `keys` rejected on send** — `POST /hijack/.../send` returns HTTP 400 when `keys`
  is absent or empty.
- **`owner` default hardened** — `POST /hijack/acquire` defaults `owner` to `"operator"`
  instead of an empty string when the field is omitted.

### Removed

- **`bridge/upstream_ws.py`** — unused file with no importers; deleted to reduce dead surface area.

### Tests

- 55 unit tests (+ 4 E2E skipped by default; run with `-m e2e` or `E2E=1`).
- `test_api_contracts.py` — enforces REST API shape parity against TypedDicts in `contracts.py`.
- `test_security_hardening.py` — JWT validation, query-token policy, lease clamping, and
  admin-only route guards.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-06

Initial release of the Cloudflare Workers port.

### Added

- **`SessionRuntime` Durable Object** — multiplexes worker and browser WebSocket connections
  for a single `worker_id`; uses the CF Hibernation API (`webSocketOpen` / `webSocketMessage` /
  `webSocketClose` / `webSocketError` / `alarm`) to survive DO restarts with near-zero cost.
- **SQLite-backed state** — `SqliteStateStore` persists hijack leases, the last terminal
  snapshot, and an event ring-buffer (cap 2000) via `ctx.storage.sql.exec`.
- **REST hijack API parity** — acquire / heartbeat / snapshot / events / send / step / release
  endpoints with lease expiry, heartbeat renewal, and lease-bounds clamping (1 s – 3600 s).
- **JWT / JWKS authentication** — `auth/jwt.py` supports symmetric and asymmetric keys with
  configurable clock skew; `dev` and `none` modes for local development.
- **Default Worker** — routes to `SessionRuntime` DO stubs via `idFromName`; serves `/api/sessions`
  and static assets with fallback to the `provide-terminal` frontend package.
- **`HijackCoordinator`** — pure in-memory hijack arbitration with session UUID generation.
- **CLI entry point** — `uterm-cf` for local development and deployment helpers.
